        <h2>Certification Meeting</h2>

        <div id="rrk-div" class="team-builder-tool-workspace disabled-workspace">
            <p>Hosting a Team Member Certification Meeting shows that your business is growing! This means you have a new member who is ready to start building their business and needs to
                become certified so that their business tools can be activated. Well done!</p>
            <p>As you learned from your Entrepreneurship Training, as soon as your new Team Member has completed their Entrepreneurship Training and practiced the skills they’ve learned, it will be
                time for you to lead their Certification Training Meeting. As their Sponsor, you play a central role in helping your new member complete this special certification process.</p>
            <p>Remember, you are your new member’s life-line, along with the other Support Team Members who are participating with you. Your most important job (as well as the entire Support Team’s
                job) is to put your new member at ease. It is up to you to make sure your new member feels welcome, a part of the team and feels safe as they demonstrate the skills they have
                practiced. The better <strong>YOU</strong> are at making your Team Member feel confident, safe, and important, the better they will be at performing the skills they have worked so hard at perfecting.
                Setting this tone and providing this kind of environment during the meeting is your responsibility, so be the best sponsor you can be!</p>
            <p>As you review the agenda below, you will see that you will serve as the Team Leader of this meeting. Follow the flow of this meeting as outlined and prepare yourself so you can lead this
                meeting with confidence.To print this outline, <a href="{{ url('/files/Printed_Doc_linked_to_email_to_Sponsor_when_Member_requests_certification_2019-09-01.pdf') }}" target="_blank">click here.</a></p>

            <h3>Host Pre-Meeting Preparation</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>Reach out to your new member to congratulate them on completing their Entrepreneurship Training and preparing to be certified. Be sure they have completed all the items to be
                        reviewed in the Certification Meeting (see agenda below). Encourage them to review the Certification Meeting Outline on Page 49 of their Entrepreneurship Training Workbook as
                        part of their final preparation.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Schedule the online video meeting in Zoom or another service of your choice and send a calendar appointment to your team member. Be sure to include the connection
                        information in your calendar invite.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Think through who on your team or in your up-line network of leaders would lend great support and insight to your team member’s certification experience and include them in
                        your calendar appointment as well. If you feel strongly about someone joining the Certification Meeting as part of the Support Team, you may even want to give them a call and
                        extend a personal invitation and let them know what a difference it would make if they would join.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>On the day of the Certification Meeting, send a reminder text to everyone who will participate in the meeting. Review the agenda before the call so it is fresh in you mind. Initiate
                        the web video meeting 10 minutes before the start time so you are first in the meeting room and can warmly welcome and chat with team members as they come on.</p>
                </li>
                <li><p>Enjoy the meeting and do your best to make it a great experience for all.</p></li>

            <h3>Welcome and Introductions</h3>
            <p>After you welcome all those attending the meeting, introduce the new member and let them tell a little about themselves. Then invite the other Support Team Members to introduce
                themselves, in turn, so everyone can get to know each other. </p>

            <h3>Purpose of Certification</h3>
            <p>The purpose of a certification meeting is to 1) build a relationship between the new member and their Support Team, and 2) ensure each new member is ready to start building their
                business by having them demonstrate they can naturally, accurately and confidently ask questions and use the Elite Health Challenge and Elite Business Challenge page storylines to
                contact and converse with those on their list, and invite them to start the Challenge or join their team in building a business. </p>

            <h3>Review Health and Business Income Goals and Dates</h3>
            <p>Invite your new member to share their Health Goal and Business Income Goal, the dates by which they would like to achieve them, and the difference it will make in their lives when they
                reach their goals.</p>

            <h3>Review Next Step Goals and Actions for Coming Week</h3>
            <p>Here your new member will share their Next Step Goal for their Health Goal and Income Goal and the Actions they are committed to take in the coming week to achieve them. The
                Support Team should offer encouragement and congratulations on their goals, along with any suggestions or feedback.</p>

            <h3>Review of Names of Potential Customers and Team Members</h3>
            <p>Now it is time to have your new member share the Top 5 Names on both their Potential Customer List and their Potential Team Member List (10 names total). Have them also share what
                it is about them that led your new member to choose them.</p>

            <h3>Role Plays: Potential Customer and Potential Team Member Conversation, with Team Feedback & Congratulations</h3>
            <p>Next, invite your new member to engage in a role play to illustrate the conversation they will have with one name on each of their Potential Customer and Potential Team Member Lists.
                Your new member may choose who they would like to play the role of the potential customer and the potential team member in the role plays. Have them be sure to use the questions,
                listen, and use the storyline if each website for their conversations. If your new member feels some initial jitters, don’t worry, that’s natural. Assure them that they are safe and in good
                hands and that you, too, felt awkward at this stage when you were getting certified. Let them know you and all the Support Team members are happy to be there to cheer them on. Invite
                your new member to repeat this process until they feel comfortable and relaxed. This will be such a great moment for them. Help them take a deep breath and encourage them to just be
                themselves. Ask the Support Team for feedback and helpful hints as they try again. </p>
            <p>Repeat this process to confirm your new member knows the features and content of both websites and their Dashboard and feels comfortable using the information to answer
                questions. </p>

            <h3>Call to Action</h3>
            <p>Help your new member select two contacts from their lists that they want to engage with first. Recommend that they start with the 3rd and 4th names on their lists, as this lets them
                polish their invitation with these individuals and saves their best invitation for the 1st and 2nd people! Remind your new member that their goal is to enroll two customers and two
                members in the next two weeks, so they should get started quickly! Also, if they don’t get the response they desire, encourage them to reach out to you immediately so you can help
                role-play and refine their skills so they can try again. It is your responsibility to take these steps with your new member. Let them know you are standing by in case they need assistance.
                This is where the rubber meets the road—it is up to you to support and help your people succeed.</p>

            <h3>Congratulate New Member</h3>
            <p>Congratulate your new member for their great work. This is a big deal and let them know you recognize it! Reaffirm that you—and their entire Support Team—will be there to walk with
                them side by side as they move forward.</p>

            <h3>Confirm Next Team Meeting &amp; Adjourn</h3>
            <p>Thank each member for participating, confirm date and time of new Members next Team Meeting (the one YOU are leading) and adjourn.</p>

            <h3>Activate New Team Member</h3>
            <p>Go to the Member Activation menu item in your Dashboard and click on the “Activate” button next to the new members name and their business tools will become active. </p>
