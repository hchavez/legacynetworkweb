        <p>
        Many years ago, the scientific community was struck by a newly discovered 
        molecule and its promise to profoundly impact the overall health of the human body.

        Due to its far-reaching benefits, the journal, Science, named it "Molecule of the Year"
        in 1992 and the excitement around this discovery mounted. <br> <br>

        In 1998, Dr Louis J. Ignarro was awarded the prestigious Nobel Prize in Medicine "for his
        discovery concerning nitric oxide as a signaling molecule in the cardiovascular system". Since
        then, nitric oxide has been "called the 'miracle molecule' and the 'spark of life' because of its
        extraordinary importance in the health of virtually every cell in the body," says Dr. Ignarro.
        He claims, "it is becoming more and more clear that nitric oxide is a molecule that may
        <a href="{{ asset('files/ProArgi9_ScienceInfoSheet_USen.pdf') }}" target="_blank" >prevent and cure many diseases at once</a>"  <br> <br>

        Over the past decades, the landslide of new scientific data revealing the far-reaching power this
        discovery offers has drawn the interest of hundreds-even thousands- of MD's, PhD's, biochemists,
        reseachers and more, to see where this discovery can take humanity. <br> <br>

        Science now shoes that the only kwown pre-curser to nitric oxide in the human body, is I â€” arginine, a
        humble amino acid. When consumed, I-arginine has the ability to convert itself into nitric oxide, thus
        aiding the health of the  <br> <br>
