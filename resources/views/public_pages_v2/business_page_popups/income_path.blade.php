            <h3 class='heading'>The income path</h3>

            <p>As you build your business, you are rewarded for your own personal business
                development and by helping your team members grow their businesses. </p>

            <p>Legacy Network’s Business Challenge provides a specific Building Plan that puts
                Members on track of powerful income. We call this Building Plan a 2(+2) in 2 and
                is based on Members enrolling at least two Business Partners and two
                Customers in a two-week period of time and then helping their Business
                Partners to do the same. That’s it!</p>

            <p>Although this Income Path is not a guarantee of income, it does accurately
                illustrate what is possible as you and your Team rise to the Challenge and
                complete a 2(+2) in 2! </p>

            <p>If you want to increase your income beyond what is illustrated, or shorten the
                time it takes to reach these income goals, enroll more Business Partners and/or
                Customers into your business and teach your Team to do the same. </p>

            <p>It is the duplication of Teams building Teams that deliver this income and is how
                large networks are built. </p>

            <p>The total number of members and customers needed on your weak leg to
                generate this income is: </p>
            <p>MONTH 1: 3<br>
                MONTH 2: 15<br>
                MONTH 3: 63</p>
