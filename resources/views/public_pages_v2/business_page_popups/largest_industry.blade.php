            <p>Recent scientific discoveries have uncovered a fascinating ecosystem within each of us called the <a id='p-youtube' href='' target='_blank'>microbiome</a>. This complex network of bacteria, fungi, and microflora reside primarily in the gut and impact the health of virtually every system in the human body. The microbiome accounts for 90% of the cells that create YOU. These cells can work for you or against you.</p>

            <p>Toxins in the environment, a sedentary lifestyle, and a diet high in sugar and processed foods are creating an unhealthy gut microbiome. The endotoxins it produces spread throughout the body and damage core body systems and organs. This <a href='{{ asset('files/MicrobiomeBreach_Infographic_USen.pdf') }}' target='_blank'>breach</a> is causing havoc in our bodies including inflammation, increased waistline and fat storage, low energy, elevated blood pressure, increased blood sugar, high triglyceride levels, and low HDL (good) cholesterol levels. </p>

                    analysis to ensure ingredients (and finished products) are free of heavy metals,
                    pesticides, dirt, and other fillers that could potentially contaminate natural
