            <h3 class='heading'>WHY THIS BUSINESS?</h3>

            <p><strong>TRENDS</strong><br> Deloitte, the global consulting and advisory services company, projects that
                between 2017 and 2022, the global healthcare market will grow from $7.7 trillion to $10.1
                trillion—making it the largest and one of the fastest growing industries in the history of the world. We
                provide first-to-market product solutions that address the problems that are driving this explosive market today
                at their core— and have the scientific proof to back up our claims.</p>

            <p><strong>TIMING</strong> <br>
                Momentum is a statistical law taught in many universities today. Momentum is defined as the unit of time
                when a business grows exponentially from small to big. Participation in a company during this growth
                window profoundly increases an individual’s ability to capitalize on the exponential growth of the company.
            </p>

            <p>Experts say that more than 80% of the millionaires created by a company are those who strategically
                position during this time. By definition, momentum is triggered when a company’s sales exceed approximately $4M
                dollars per month and is followed by double and triple digit growth for several years in a row. </p>
            <p>Everything created and offered through Legacy Network (the training, support, the building plan, the
                income plan, the education summits, the business tools , the products, etc…) have all been created to help
                members position themselves to take full advantage of the growth that we are expected to see in the coming
                years. </p>

            <p><strong>INCOME POTENTIAL</strong><br> Although there are many aspects that make Legacy Network’s Business
                Plan powerful, when you break it down, one of the most compelling aspects is its unprecedented income
                model. Following our step-by-step Building Plan, we put our members on a specific income track that
                helps them reach their goals.</p>

            <p>MONTH 1 GOAL: $496 and cover your initial investment<br>
                MONTH 2 GOAL: $822<br>
                MONTH 3 GOAL: $4,500+<br>
                MONTH 4 and beyond: Watch your income continue to grow…</p>

            <p>From a business standpoint, there are not many income models, if any, that rival this.</p>

            <p><strong>SIMPLE BUILDING PLAN</strong> <br>
                Legacy Network’s Business Challenge provides a speciﬁc building plan that puts members on track of
                powerful income. We call this Building Plan a 2(+2) in 2 and is based on Members enrolling at least two
                Business Partners and two Customers in a two-week period of time and then helping their Business
                Partners to do the same. That’s it!</p>

            <p>This duplicating activity drives the growth of the network and the number of people using and sharing the
                products and the income for every participating member.</p>
