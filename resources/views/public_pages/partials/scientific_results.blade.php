                    The Hughes Center for Research and Innovation is taking on society’s greatest chronic
                    health challenges—most driven by poor diet and lifestyle choices—through natural,
                    nutritional therapeutics. That’s right, natural therapeutics, not pharmaceuticals. Outfitted
                    with state-of-the-art instrumentation, the Hughes Center is the hub of Synergy
                    WorldWide's new product development. Utilizing the center’s advanced technology,
                    Hughes Center scientists verify the identity, purity, and potency of potential product
                    ingredients and develop powerful and unique product formulations that support
                    metabolic health through the gut microbiome. If a formulation proves itself in clinical
                    studies, it joins Synergy’s family of Elite Health products.

                    The body of evidence emerging from these human clinical trials is not only promising, it
                    allows you to build your business with confidence—knowing that the rigors of science
                    back up the quality and efficacy of the products you use and share with others.

                    Here is a preview of the clinical trial results coming out of the Hughes Center on just a
                    couple of our products:
                </p>
                <strong>1—METABOLIC LDL</strong>
                <p>
                    Metabolic LDL’s unique herbal formula helps modulate cholesterol oxidation, maintain
                    healthy cholesterol levels, and support healthy cardiovascular function.
                    The Hughes Center conducted a clinical study intended to examine the safety and
                    efficacy of the Metabolic LDL formula. With Citrus bergamia Risso as the chief
                    ingredient, amplified by nine other phytoextracts known to enhance its antioxidant and
                    anti-inflammatory capabilities, this new formula featured potential benefits that our
                    scientists were confident would be proven.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Eleven subjects between the ages of 38 and 65 years old were selected to participate in
                    this study based upon their body mass index, LDL cholesterol, and triglyceride levels. All
                    participants were instructed to take two capsules with dinner each day for twelve weeks
                    to maximize the effectiveness of the dosage.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the end of the twelve-week period, the following significant changes were observed
                    in all subjects:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>7.3% reduction in total cholesterol, and</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>10% reduction in LDL-cholesterol</strong></li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    At the start of the study, eight of the eleven subjects had HbA1c levels (a signal for
                    prediabetes or diabetes) of 5.4 or higher. These individuals experienced the following
                    additional significant changes:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>27% reduction in triglycerides</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>19% reduction in oxidized LDL</strong></li>
                </ol>
                <br>
                <strong>2—FORTIFY</strong>
                <p>
                    Fortify is a proprietary program that combines positive lifestyle changes with nutritional
                    supplements to strengthen metabolic function and microbiome gut health and achieve
                    and maintain healthy body composition.

                    A clinical study performed by the Hughes Center began with two groups of generally
                    healthy people. For 90 days, scientists monitored the metabolic health of both groups,
                    looking closely at key biomarkers such as blood pressure, body fat, and cholesterol.
                    Participants in both groups followed diet and exercise recommendations but only the
                    second group received the added benefits of Synergy’s Microbiome health products. At
                    the end of 90 days, the group who received Synergy’s supplements experienced
                    stunning results— 56% more weight loss, 65% more fat loss, 125% greater reduction in
                    systolic blood pressure, 62% greater reduction in diastolic blood pressure, 66% greater
                    reduction in total cholesterol, 80% greater reduction in LDL (the “bad” cholesterol) and
                    268% improvement in cholesterol/HDL Ratio!
