                    The MICROBIOME is a fascinating, complex network of bacteria, fungi, and microflora
                    that reside primarily in the gut and that impact the health of virtually every system in the
                    human body. In fact, the microbiome accounts for 90% of the cells in your body. Your
                    microbiomeâ€™s health affects your brain function, weight, mood, immune system, and GI
                    tract. Protecting and supporting the good microbes is just as important as eliminating
                    the bad ones. We help you do both by purifying the microbiome.

                    The <strong>Purify</strong> Program includes a one-week supply of clinically formulated nutrition for the
                    microbiome. Probiotics, vegetable proteins, and many other powerful ingredients
                    combine to promote detoxification, cleansing, and balance. When combined with
                    healthy eating and moderate daily exercise, these supplements will begin to rebuild and
                    optimize your health from the inside out.
